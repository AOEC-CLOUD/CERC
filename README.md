# CERC
Connected Emergency Response as SAAI Factory solution to use art/art forms/art work/allied innovation and AI/ML to protect and save life of occupants at the time of disaster, threat or accelerated risk.

We find that Art and AI/ML can be used in artwork/system design/system operation/ system management/system maintenance/system incidence management/system 
repair/system  documentation and even connected emergency response.

Vision for The Project Millennium's Sustainable development goal: How can scientific and technological breakthroughs be accelerated to improve the human condition?

Scope or potential problem solving: 
We propose the augmenting of regular art, styles or features for a newer CERC-art which helps Emergency Response at a building, facility or site by relating to Visual, Auditory or Tactile senses via an Ability specific LifeScore Accentuated Risk mitigator.

Today amidst the various features of art/artwork/allied innovations, the newer CERC-art will need to relate to Service Level Agreements (SLA(s)), Operations Level Agreements (OLA(s)), Underpinning Contracts (UC(s) ) and LifeScores, which it expects to associate via an Ability specific LifeScore Accentuated Risk mitigator (or ALARM) .

The Risk mitigator identifies the problem solving or resultant SMART Interaction / Intervention possible through the artwork / art form / allied innovation.
